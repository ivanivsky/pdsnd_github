### Project Title
Explore US Bike Share Data

### Description
This project analyzes data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), which is a bike share provider for many major cities in the U.S.

The purpose of the project to uncover bike share usage patterns across three cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, D.C.

The bike share usage patterns includes various stats, including:
- The most popular times of travel
- Popular stations and trips
- Trip duration
- User info (gender, year of birth, etc)

### Files used
Included in this project is bikeshare.py, which is the Python script written in Python 3.

Not included, are the datasets themselves. The datasets for each of the cities can be found here:
